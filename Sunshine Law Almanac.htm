They may take a few minutes to do so—after all, it’s a big decision, and other players may give advice on what to guess, but it is always the VIP’s decision. If they are wrong on both counts, the game ends immediately and the VIP's team loses. If they guess at least one right, nothing happens and the game continues.

After much yelling and confusion, the VIP guesses their clockwise neighbour is the ITAR Enforcer and that their anticlockwise neighbour is the Socialite. Night falls, and the game continues.

Saiyam's anticlockwise neighbour is Han, the Informant. In the morning, when the Storyteller informs the group that Saiyam is dead, Saiyam says "Ok everybody, I was the VIP" the town discusses for a few minutes, Han does not want to reveal that he is the Informant. Saiyam publicly guesses that Vivek is the Celebrity and Han is the Propagandist. The evil team wins.

                                    This can be by verbally hinting they are evil, or by nominating a neighbour and giving a convincing reason. It is always up to the Storyteller to decide what the Useful Idiot is doing. If you think they are not trying hard enough to convince the group that that one of their neighbours is evil, you can execute the Useful Idiot or either of their neighbours, even outside the nomination phase, or at night.

Wake a living evil Outsider. Show them the YOU ARE info token and the Agitator token. Change their character to an Agitator. Put the new Agitator to sleep. (Unlike “Once per game” abilities, this ONCE reminder stays there for the rest of the game. Don’t remove it, even if the Agitator dies or changes character.)

Replace the Illegal token with the not-in-play good character and mark them with the IS ILLEGAL reminder token. Don't forget to Flip their character token upside down to represent that they are evil.
